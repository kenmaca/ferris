# Contracted Website for the Ferris Wheel Press

I designed and created this website as contracted work for Ferris Wheel Press as part of Palettera's foray into lifestyle stationery products. I worked closely with both the President and their artistic team from start to finish for several months to completion and pushed it live on schedule in Q4 2017.

Palettera is an internationally acclaimed medium-sized branding and business stationery production studio for companies like the Sick Kids Foundation's Oceana Ball for the Herbie Fund, the Canadian Arts and Fashion Awards, the Toronto Fashion Incubator, Canadian Fabric, and the David Foster Foundation Miracle Concerts.

## Type of work

This was mostly animation heavy web design with a cool landing page that can be viewed live: http://ferriswheelpress.com

HTML5, CSS, jQuery, Skeleton, ScrollMagic, GSAP, and the Shopify API were used.
